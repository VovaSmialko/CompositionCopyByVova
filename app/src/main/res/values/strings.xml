        Rules of the game: there will be three figures in front of you, two from the bottom and one from the top, two of them will have
        numbers It is necessary that the sum of the numbers from the two lower figures is equal to the number in the upper figure,
        for this, you need to insert the missing number.\n\nExample: in the upper circle is the number 7, in one
        from the bottom there is a question mark, and in the second the number 4. So there should be a question mark in place of the question mark
        be the number 3, because 3 + 4 = 7
